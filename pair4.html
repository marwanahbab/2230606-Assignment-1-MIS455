                        Less naked carbon, more chance for the designers to flex their creative chops â€” and Haas has delivered something that should stand out more than its usually conservative efforts. A fresh spin on the white, black, and red tones that it has stuck to in the past few seasons looks good, and it's refreshing to see the sidepods get a bit more of a brighter treatment than just a giant Haas logo splodged on the face. Is it the standout from the batch? No, but it's unmistakably brand loyal and represents one of the more imaginative efforts from the American squad.

                        The Car is very white, but with the clearest Red Bull iconography that the team has used since its days as Toro Rosso. 

                        There's the yellow nose cap and roll hoop, flanked by the scarlet hues of the energy drink brand's bull logo. The white backdrop is likely all the better for the myriad sponsors involved, which no longer have to rely on the clumsy white blocks of colour hurled onto the metallic blue tones that RB used last year. 
                        
                        There's at least a little bit of blue on the car, albeit at the rear as it progresses into an MC Escher-esque transition from a dark blue to white with the use of further Red Bull logos.
                        
                        Think Red Bull's revered 2020 Turkey one-off livery, but perhaps a little more cluttered. It's still pretty nice, though
