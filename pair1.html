                        Team principal Andrea Stella stated that McLaren wanted continuity with its constructors' championship winner from 2024, and it's done that; it keeps the papaya flashes draped on top of black carbon in pretty much exactly the same arrangement as before. For those hoping for something a little bit more from the team, then you'll be disappointed. Ultimately isn't a bad livery by any stretch, but it's not a great one either; it just merely exists to maintain its post-Ron Dennis-era identity and act as a platform for its plentiful commercial partners. Could there be more orange? Yes. Could the team have played about with the form factor a little more? Yes. But hey, they like what they had - and thats okay.

                        It's red, but it appears to be a much bloodier hue - much like in 2022 - versus the shades of red used over the past couple of years. The added white on the engine cover, naturally to accentuate the HP title sponsorship, rather harks back to the Michael Schumacher days â€” particularly at the races when its Marlboro sponsorship was covered up by a white square. The yellow notes are gone, which is a little bit sad. And if we're being really picky, the UniCredit sponsorship doesn't entirely sit well with the rest of the car; the white outlines look a little clumsy. At least the accent stripe relates to its similar World Endurance Championship livery.I don't hate this - actually, it's a decent effort to wrap in HP's corporate desires into Ferrari's historic back catalogue of red and white efforts. But I suspect I might be in the minority.
