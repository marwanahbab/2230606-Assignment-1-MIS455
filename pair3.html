                        This livery is a considerable downgrade. It's hard to go wrong with British Racing Green, especially with Aston Martin's modern-day icon of fluorescent yellow trim, but the black sidepods appear completely incongruous with the rest of the livery. Is that a hint that the AMR25 will roll out in Bahrain with a little bit of a weight problem, and that the revised sidepods are going to be in naked carbon in Bahrain testing? We wait, indeed, with bated breath.It's hard to love the new direction for the livery, especially as Aston Martin could have played this very safe and turned up with something that still looked stellar

                        That's more like it! After last year's woeful effort as it eschewed paintwork in line with its overweight chassis, Alpine at least started to add a little bit more paint back onto the car towards the end of 2024. This time, it's back with a bang â€“ and for followers of F1 esoterica, with a paint job similar to Brabham's 1992 BT60B.  

                        The pink nose wouldn't flawlessly merge with the metallic blue, so the carbon black has been kept sparingly to create space between the two. To see Alpine's 'proper' brand colours back in F1 is a welcome sight, and the team has been bold with its inventive contrast between colours. In other words, it's anathema to last year's carbon-heavy liveries. 
                        
                        Further notes: the team has opened its livery space on the engine cover to new fuel partner Eni, which returns to F1 for the first time (when it was Agip) since 2000. You'll see the pink and blue machines from a mile away - which is what a distinctive livery is all about. Quite the turnaround - chapeau, Alpine.
