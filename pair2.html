                        The same. As usual. It's become a bit tired (and the cringe factor of the presentation) brings it down a couple of points.

                        Is there anything more to add? Oh, the sponsor on the rear wing is different. That's...something.

                        Same, but different. The extra silver on the engine cover and flanks is a nice touch, which upgrades the already-pretty 2024 livery. That begs the question over the scope of INEOS' involvement with the team, as the red flash that usually surrounded its rollhoop branding is gone - as is said branding, much reduced over the revised livery that will adorn the W16. The use of Petronas teal remains tasteful, separated from the silver by the use of black around the car, as suitable Mercedes branding continues to pepper the livery's blanker spots. As we said, it's an upgrade and I'm quite fond of it. Perhaps there was more scope to be imaginative around the sidepods, which remain black with a teal flash. Otherwise, it's a lovely livery..
