                        It's blue. Very blue. I mean, it's fine if you like blue, with a dark blue to medium blue gradient through the car. But it just feels a little bit...low effort, perhaps? The tesselating blue pattern from the previous couple of cars is gone, and the yellow engine cover tease used at the end of last season is nothing but a distant memory. It appears the overall livery has been simplified to accentuate the rather conspicuous Atlassian logos now added to the engine cover as Williams has signed what has been touted as its biggest title partnership ever. The Duracell battery engine cover remains, but the novelty has probably worn off.

                        The key issue with 2024's livery was that it looked somewhat pedestrian; the weight-saving efforts with the nude carbon fully dampened the potential of leading with a neon green scheme.  

                        Thankfully, this year's effort is much more cohesive. Clearly influenced by the better reception its Las Vegas rendition got, the use of green is more liberal in the first two-thirds of the car. Then there's a fade gradient that transitions into what appears to be naked carbon at the rear. 
                        
                        The car shown at the event seemed to be in a much less ennobling livery than the launch images revealed by the team in its press materials. If the actual car looks like the render images, and if that gradient actually blends well into the carbon, then it could be a hit.
